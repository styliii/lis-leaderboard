My first foray into playing with meteor.js.  I simply cloned the example and added extra features per their recommendation.

1.  Toggle button that sorts by name or points
2.  Reset scores button that resets the score randomly
3.  The ability to click on a player and remove them via button
4.  The ability to add a player
